# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_Apps_Script.svg/768px-Google_Apps_Script.svg.png" alt="Google Apps Script" width="40" height="40"/> Google Apps Script was my first programming language #

I didn't even realize it was a sub-set of javascript when I started however I've come to realize it is a great entry to the world of programming. <br >
For anybody who is comfortable working with Google apps such as Slides, Docs and Sheets, Apps script can be a perfect opening to the world of programming. Because of the built-in apis we can interact with different Google Apps and see inmediate results from our work. <br />
### Within this repository I share different projects as well as practice resources for anyone interested in exploring different methods and algorithms when interacting with the Google Apps. ###
