# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Google_Apps_Script.svg/768px-Google_Apps_Script.svg.png" alt="Google Apps Script" width="40" height="40"/> Google Apps Script was my first programming language #

I didn't even realize it was a sub-set of javascript when I started however I've come to realize it is a great entry to the world of programming. <br >
For anybody who is comfortable working with Google apps such as Slides, Docs and Sheets, Apps script can be a perfect opening to the world of programming. Because of the built-in apis we can interact with different Google Apps and see inmediate results from our work. <br />
### Within this repository I share different projects as well as practice resources for anyone interested in exploring different methods and algorithms when interacting with the Google Apps. ###

| Link to resource | App | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [iterateSlides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M935Rlmmc34RATZuDHvcMWiqY_qKG4pysf_RK2NguCY/copy) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Google_Slides_logo_%282014-2020%29.svg/1489px-Google_Slides_logo_%282014-2020%29.svg.png" alt="Google Apps Script" width="40" height="48"/> | Short Presentation with a Script demonstrating different ways to iterate over slides and get information and elements from each slide. More of a beginner level. |

However this is a great exercise to begin with triggers and if statements. |
