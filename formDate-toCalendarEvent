// Very simple Script to have anybody fill out a form and have an event created. This event will be created on the form owner's calendar and whoever is submitting the form will be invited as a guest.

// Make a copy of the Form woth the following link. Then create a Response Sheet. Open the Apps Script editor and paste in this script
// https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aME78EsIUFjvoH7wUSQ2A_hV7yLIQHYRaO-vNVY-UKs/copy

function formToCalEvent() {

  // You can get Any aditional created calendar by using getCalendarById();
  const primCal = CalendarApp.getDefaultCalendar();
  const ssResponses = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Form Responses 1');
  const ssResponsesData = ssResponses.getDataRange().getValues();
  const lastRowData = ssResponses.getLastRow() - 1;

  let email = ssResponsesData[lastRowData][1];
  let eventTitle = ssResponsesData[lastRowData][2];

  // It is VERY IMPORTANT that you have your SpreadSheet as well as your Script and Calendar Timezones set to the SAME. In this example I work in GMT+2. Then Format the date to what CalendarApp expects to create events
  let day = Utilities.formatDate(ssResponsesData[lastRowData][3], "GMT+2", "MMMM dd, yyyy");

  // Use substring method to get only the hours, minutes from time question which is parsed as a full date
  let start = ssResponsesData[lastRowData][4].toString().substring(16, 24);
  let end = ssResponsesData[lastRowData][5].toString().substring(16, 24);

  // Construct the start and en objects
  let eventStart = new Date(day + " " + start);
  let eventEnd = new Date(day + " " + end);

  // Create event and add email of person who submitted the form. CalendarApp WILL NOT send an email
  primCal.createEvent(eventTitle, eventStart, eventEnd).addGuest(email);
